Original tuple format
<date, sourceNum, destNum, length, cost>

Exercise 1
----------
1. Filter all the tuples and leave only those corresponding to the specified
   date range and the specified sourceNum.
2. Map the remaining tuples to obtain tuples of the format <month, cost>, where
   month just extracts the month from the given date.
3. Reduce the resulting tuples by month, by adding their cost. The result of
   this operation should be a list of tuples, one per month, containing the
   cost of the service for that month for the given user.

Exercise 2
----------
1. Filter all the tuples and leave only those corresponding to 2015 and the
   specified sourceNum
2. Map the remaining tuples to obtain tuples of the format <isInNetwork, cost>,
   where isInNetwork is a transformation of the destNum that returns a boolean
   value indicating if the destNum starts with 333 or not.
3. Reduce the resulting tuples by isInNetwork, by summing their cost. The result
   of this operation should be just two tuples corresponding to the total money
   spent during 2015 calling numbers in and out the network.
4. Map the resulting tuples  by just dividing the total cost over 12 to obtain
   the monthly average.
