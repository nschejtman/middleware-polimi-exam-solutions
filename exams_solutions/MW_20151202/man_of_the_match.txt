Original tuple
<timestamp, idUser, idMatch, ManOfMatch>

1. Filter the list of tuples and select only those corresponding to the past
   year

2. Map the remaining tuples from <timestamp, idUser, idMatch, ManOfMatch> to
   <ManOfTheMatch, 1>

3. Reduce the obtained tuples by summing their values. This should produce
   tuples of the type <ManOfTheMatch, where nâ‰¥1 is the amount of times the
   player has been selected man of the match.
