WSDL stands for Web Service Description Language. It is an XML specification of
a web service. It's kind of a syntactic contract between a service provider and
a service consumer. WSDL describes four pieces of data:
  * Interface information: describes all the publicly available functions
  * Data type information: describes the format of the data carries by messages
  * Binding information: describes the transport protocol used (remember SOAP
    allows to use different transport protocols)
  * Address information: for locating the specified service

All of this is described in a WSDL file, which contains the following tags:
  * <types> : which define data types
  * <message> : what messages will be transmitted
  * <portType> : a group of operations, which can be of the following types
    - Request-response
    - Solicit-response
    - One way
    - Notification
    all of these which can be either synchronous or asynchronous
  * <binding> : how the messages will be transferred on the wire. It contains
    the following parts:
     - Binding type (RPC/literal, RPC/encoded, document/literal,
       document/encoded, document/literal wrapped)
     - SOAP operation (function name, input params and return params)
  * <port> : specifies an individual endpoint by specifying a single address for
    a binding
  * <service> : where is the service located. It list all the available ports
    for that service
